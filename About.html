  <p class="p2"><b>Our History:</b></p>
  <p class="p2">Camp 31 was founded in 1908 as a "Saw Mill General Store" outside of Brewton, Alabama.<br><br> In 1985, Camp 31 BBQ was established by Larry Murphy, who has been serving up mouth-watering authentic southern BBQ ever since. In 1986, the Brewton Police Deptartment helped us enter our first BBQ cook off in Pensacola, Florida. In the 1986 cook-off we won <mark>three first place trophies</mark>, and since, touring of the US and Canada has been nonstop! The store is now headquarters to our award-winning cook-off team. Look for us at an event near you! Along with the awards and trophies, we are still one of the highest productive BBQ teams on and off the road today.<br><br>In 2021, Larry decided it was time to enjoy his success and transition into retirement. With this, he transferred ownership to long-time Head Chef, Adam Manasco, and his wife, Stephanie Manasco. Under Larry's guidance and presence, the new owners are committed to keep on cooking the best Southern Style Bar-B-Que around -- slow smoked over hickory logs ensuring the most tender, mouth-watering meat and the most flavorful rib experience!</p>
